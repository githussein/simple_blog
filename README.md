Coding challenge by Mohamed Hussein applying for the position of Flutter Developer.

## Message to the reviewer

Dear code reviewer,

There are many scenarios where more changes could be done to the code. THings like deleting an
article or make the image thumbnail editable, or using some package for state management like
the Provider package, add a presentation layer, or even add some animations.
I have already implemented many more during my previous projects for companies I worked at and
some of them are already shared in my repositories. I just wanted to stick to all that were
mentioned in your video for time management reasons. However, I would be glad to invest more
time to add implement any extra version you'd want to see.

I am looking forward to your feedback!

Kind regards,
Mohamed Hussein
